# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.


Rating: 7/10

Strengths:

Clean, modern layout with good use of whitespace.
Sticky navbar and clear branding.
Hero section is prominent and easy to read.
Vending machine popout section is visually appealing, with boxed features and a central image.
Responsive design works well on desktop and mobile.
Custom assets and colors match your brand.
Areas for Improvement:

The header area above the hero section is quite tall and could be tightened for better visual balance.
The background image is attractive but a bit washed out; consider increasing contrast or adding a subtle overlay for more depth.
The boxed features could use slightly more contrast or shadow for extra "pop" (like the reference site).
Typography could be refinedâ€”try adjusting font sizes and weights for hierarchy, especially in feature boxes.
The call-to-action button could be larger and more visually distinct.
Consider adding subtle animations (fade-in, hover effects) for more polish.
Footer and lower sections could use more visual interest or content.
Summary:
Your landing page is clean, professional, and easy to navigate. With a few tweaks to spacing, contrast, and typography, you can push it closer to a 9 or 10 and match the reference site even more closely. Great progress!
